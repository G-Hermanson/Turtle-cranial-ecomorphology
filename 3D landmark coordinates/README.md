# 3D landmark data
This folder contains the 3D landmark coordinates for both the "full landmark dataset" and the "partial landmark dataset", each in a separate sub-folder. Specimens data are given in _.TXT_ format, whereas the _.CSV_ files contain additional landmark information needed for downstream analyses.

- The "Landmarks_full_dataset" sub-folder contains coordinates data for 71 extant turtles used in ordination steps (GPA, PCA) and hypothesis tests, including D-PGLS (skull shape), pGLS (skull size) and 2B-PLS (covariance between skull emarginations).

- The "Landmarks_partial_dataset" sub-folder contains coordinates data for 76 extant and 17 extinct turtles, used in ordination steps (GPA, PCA). Extant data only was used in hypothesis tests (D-PGLS, fo skull shape correlations), and both extant and extinct turtle data were used in phylogenetic flexible discriminant analyses (pFDA) to infer the presence of selected ecological and functional traits of fossil turtles.
